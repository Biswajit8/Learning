## "If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one"

## Introduction

### 1. The ONE Thing
- "Be like a postage stamp - stick to one thing until you get there."
- "Going small" is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do.
- Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.

### 2. The Domino Effect
- "Every great change starts like falling dominoes."
- Find the lead domino, and whack away at it until it falls.
- The domino effect applies to the big picture, like your work or your business, and it applies to the smallest moment in each day when you're trying to decide what to do next.
- The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time.

### 3. Success Leaves Clues
- "It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world."
- No one succeeds alone. No one.
- "Success demands singleness of purpose."
- The unintended consequence of abundance is that we are bombarded with more information and choices in a day than our ancestors received in a lifetime. Harried and hurried, a nagging sense that we attempt too much and accomplish too little haunts our days.
- The ONE Thing sits at the heart of success and is the starting point for achieving extraordinary results.

## Part I: The Lies - They mislead and derail us

"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."

### 4. Everything Matters Equally
- "The things which are most important don't always scream the loudest."
- While to-dos serve as a useful collection of our best intentions, they also tyrannize us with trivial, unimportant stuff that we feel obligated to get done - because it's on our list. Which is why most of us have a love-hate relationship with our to-dos.
- Achievers always work from a clear sense of priority.
- The majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.
- Pareto's 80/20 Principle: 20% effort, 80% results.

- A to-do list becomes a success list when you apply Pareto's Principle to it.
- 25 items (5 %) -> 5 items (5 %) -> 1 item
- Start with as large a list as you want. But develop the mindset that you will whittle your way from there to the critical few and not stop until you end with the essential ONE. The imperative ONE. The ONE Thing.
- We can't fall prey to the notion that everything has to be done, that checking things off our list is what success is all about.
- Doing the most important thing is always the most important thing.
  - Go small.
  - Go extreme.
  - Say no.
  - Don't be trapped in the "check off" game.

### 5. Multitasking
- "Multitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time."
- It's not that we have too little time to do all the things we need to do, it's that we feel the need to do too many things in the time we have.
- While doing one thing we're only seconds away from thinking of something else we could do.

- You can do two things at once, but you can't focus effectively on two things at once.
- Media multitaskers actually experience a thrill with switching - a burst of dopamine - that can be addictive. Without it, they can feel bored.
- Why would we even tolerate multitasking when we're doing the most important work?
- If we really lose almost a third of our workday to distractions, what is the cumulative loss over a career?
- Distraction undermines results: Figure out what matters most in the moment and give it your undivided attention.

### 6. A Disciplined Life
- The truth is we don't need any more discipline than we already have. We just need to direct and manage it a little better.
- Success is actually a short race — a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.
- You can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.
- The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.
- When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.
- It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.
- Those with the right habit seem to do better than others. They're doing the most important thing regularly and, as a result, everything is easier.
  - Don't be a disciplined person. Be a habit person.
  - Build one habit at a time.
  - Give each habit enough time.

### 7. Willpower Is Always on Call
- Willpower has a limited battery life.
- Complex carbohydrates and proteins become the fuel of choice for high-achievers.
- One of the real challenges we have is that when our willpower is low we tend to fall back on our default settings.

- You make doing what matters most a priority when your willpower is its highest.
- You will need your willpower at full strength to ensure that when you're doing the right thing, you don't let anything distract you or steer you away from it. Then you need enough willpower the rest of the day to either support or avoid sabotaging what you've done.
- Do your most important work — your ONE Thing — early.

### 8. A Balanced Life
