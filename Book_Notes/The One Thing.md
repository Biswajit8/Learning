## "If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one"

## Introduction

### 1. The ONE Thing
- "Be like a postage stamp - stick to one thing until you get there."
- "Going small" is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do.
- Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.

### 2. The Domino Effect
- "Every great change starts like falling dominoes."
- Find the lead domino, and whack away at it until it falls.
- The domino effect applies to the big picture, like your work or your business, and it applies to the smallest moment in each day when you're trying to decide what to do next.
- The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time.

### 3. Success Leaves Clues
- "It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world."
- No one succeeds alone. No one.
- "Success demands singleness of purpose."
- The unintended consequence of abundance is that we are bombarded with more information and choices in a day than our ancestors received in a lifetime. Harried and hurried, a nagging sense that we attempt too much and accomplish too little haunts our days.
- The ONE Thing sits at the heart of success and is the starting point for achieving extraordinary results.
