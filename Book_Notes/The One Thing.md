## "If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one"

## Introduction

### 1. The ONE Thing
- "Be like a postage stamp - stick to one thing until you get there."
- "Going small" is ignoring all the things you could do and doing what you should do.
- Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.

### 2. The Domino Effect
- "Every great change starts like falling dominoes."
- Find the lead domino, and whack away at it until it falls.
- The domino effect applies to the big picture, like your work or your business, and it applies to the smallest moment in each day when you're trying to decide what to do next.
- The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time.

### 3. Success Leaves Clues
- "It is those who concentrate on but one thing at a time who advance in this world."
- No one succeeds alone. No one.
- "Success demands singleness of purpose."
- The unintended consequence of abundance is that we are bombarded with more information and choices in a day than our ancestors received in a lifetime. Harried and hurried, a nagging sense that we attempt too much and accomplish too little haunts our days.
- The ONE Thing sits at the heart of success and is the starting point for achieving extraordinary results.

## Part I: The Lies - They mislead and derail us

"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."

### 4. Everything Matters Equally
- "The things which are most important don't always scream the loudest."
- While to-dos serve as a useful collection of our best intentions, they also tyrannize us with trivial, unimportant stuff that we feel obligated to get done - because it's on our list. Which is why most of us have a love-hate relationship with our to-dos.
- Achievers always work from a clear sense of priority.
- The majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.
- Pareto's 80/20 Principle: 20% effort, 80% results.

- A to-do list becomes a success list when you apply Pareto's Principle to it.
- 25 items (5 %) -> 5 items (5 %) -> 1 item
- Start with as large a list as you want. But develop the mindset that you will whittle your way from there to the critical few and not stop until you end with the essential ONE. The imperative ONE. The ONE Thing.
- We can't fall prey to the notion that everything has to be done, that checking things off our list is what success is all about.
- Doing the most important thing is always the most important thing.
  - Go small.
  - Go extreme.
  - Say no.
  - Don't be trapped in the "check off" game.

### 5. Multitasking
- "Multitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time."
- It's not that we have too little time to do all the things we need to do, it's that we feel the need to do too many things in the time we have.
- While doing one thing we're only seconds away from thinking of something else we could do.

  <img width="713" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa651e9c-1e1f-4dec-83f5-b954a844248c" />
  
- You can do two things at once, but you can't focus effectively on two things at once.
- Media multitaskers actually experience a thrill with switching - a burst of dopamine - that can be addictive. Without it, they can feel bored.
- Why would we even tolerate multitasking when we're doing the most important work?
- If we really lose almost a third of our workday to distractions, what is the cumulative loss over a career?
- Distraction undermines results: Figure out what matters most in the moment and give it your undivided attention.

### 6. A Disciplined Life
- The truth is we don't need any more discipline than we already have. We just need to direct and manage it a little better.
- Success is actually a short race — a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.
- You can become successful with less discipline than you think, for one simple reason: success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.
- The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it.
- When you do the right thing, it can liberate you from having to monitor everything.
- It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit.
- Those with the right habit seem to do better than others. They're doing the most important thing regularly and, as a result, everything is easier.
  - Don't be a disciplined person. Be a habit person.
  - Build one habit at a time.
  - Give each habit enough time.

### 7. Willpower Is Always on Call
- Willpower has a limited battery life.
- Complex carbohydrates and proteins become the fuel of choice for high-achievers.
- One of the real challenges we have is that when our willpower is low we tend to fall back on our default settings.

  <img width="725" height="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7558324e-41d0-47cc-813a-12207fb8c671" />
  
- You make doing what matters most a priority when your willpower is its highest.
- You will need your willpower at full strength to ensure that when you're doing the right thing, you don't let anything distract you or steer you away from it. Then you need enough willpower the rest of the day to either support or avoid sabotaging what you've done.
- Do your most important work — your ONE Thing — early.

### 8. A Balanced Life
- Purpose, meaning, significance - these are what make a successful life. Seek them and you will most certainly live your life out of balance, criss-crossing an invisible middle line as you pursue your priorities. The act of living a full life by giving time to what matters is a balancing act. Extraordinary results require focused attention and time. Time on one thing means time away from another. This makes balance impossible.
- If you think of balance as the middle, then out of balance is when you're away from it. Get too far away from the middle and you're living at the extremes.
- Attend to all things, everything gets shortchanged (unfair treatment) and nothing gets its due.
- Knowing when to pursue the middle and when to pursue the extremes is in essence the true beginning of wisdom.
- Magic happens at the extremes.
- When you gamble with your time, you may be placing a bet you can’t cover.
- Replace the word "balance" with "counterbalance" and what you experience makes sense.
- Leaving some things undone is a necessary tradeoff for extraordinary results.
- Researchers showed that individuals who worked more than 11 hours a day (a 55-plus hour workweek) were 67% more likely to suffer from heart disease.
- To achieve an extraordinary result you must choose what matters most and give it all the time it demands. This requires getting extremely out of balance in relation to all other work issues, with only infrequent counterbalancing to address them.
- When you act on your priority, you’ll automatically go out of balance, giving more time to one thing over another.
- To be able to address your priorities outside of work, be clear about your most important work priority so you can get it done. Then go home and be clear about your priorities there so you can get back to work.
- Counterbalance your work bucket: View work as involving a skill or knowledge that must be mastered. You will have to take what matters to the extremes and be okay with what happens to the rest.

### 9. Big Is Bad
- When big is believed to be bad, small thinking rules the day and big never sees the light of it. 
- No one knows their ultimate ceiling.
- It's about bold ideas that might threaten your comfort zones but simultaneously reflect your greatest opportunities.
- The only actions that become springboards to succeeding big are those informed by big thinking to begin with.

<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab6442e7-4bcb-4d38-a190-9c938e3bf88d" />

- Every level of achievement requires its own combination of what you do, how you do it, and who you do it with. 
- What you build today will either empower or restrict you tomorrow.
- If courage isn't the absence of fear but moving past it, then thinking big is in the absence of doubts but moving past them. Only living big will let you experience your true life and work potential.
  - Think big: Set a goal so far above what you want that you will be building a plan that practically guarantees your original goal.
  - Don’t order from the menu.
  - Act bold.
  - Don’t fear failure.
- Don’t let small thinking cut your life down to size. Think big, aim high, act bold.

## Part II: The Truth - The simple path to productivity

I learned that success comes down to this: being appropriate in the moments of your life. If you can honestly say, “This is where I’m meant to be right now, doing exactly what I’m doing,” then all the amazing possibilities for your life become possible.

### 10. The Focusing Question

- The quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question.
- Research shows that asking questions improves learning and performance by as much as 150%.
- Life is a question, and how we live it is our answer. How we phrase the questions we ask ourselves determines the answers that eventually become our life. 
- The focusing question:

<img width="400" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed3c2ea-8a46-467c-b686-c90ed418d7fc" />

- Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it. 
- To stay on track for the best possible day, month, year or career, you must keep asking the Focusing Question.
- The Focusing Question asks you to find the first domino and focus on it exclusively until you knock it over. Once you have done that, you will discover a line of dominoes behind it, either ready to fall or already down.
  - Great questions are the path to great answers.
  - The Focusing Question is a double-duty question.
  - The Big-Picture Question: "What’s my ONE Thing?".
  - The Small-Focus Question: "What’s my ONE Thing right now?".
- Whether you seek answers big or small, asking the focusing question is the ultimate success habit for your life.

### 11. The Success Habit

- Start with the big stuff and see where it takes you. Apply it to the important areas of your life. Spiritual life, physical health, personal life, key relationships, job, business and financial life. Address them in that order. Each one is a foundation for the next.

  - Make it a habit: Research says this will take about 66 days.
  - Leverage reminders: “Until my ONE Thing is done - everything else is a distraction.” 
  - Recruit support.

### 12. The Path to Great Answers

- Low goals don't require extraordinary actions so they rarely lead to extraordinary results.
- Answers come in three categories: doable, stretch, and possibility.
- Extraordinary results require a Great Answer. 
- Highly successful people not only dream of, but deeply crave what is beyond their natural grasp.
- As with a stretch goal, you can start out by doing research and studying the lives of other high achievers. But you can't stop there. In fact, your search has just begun.
- "Has anyone else studied or accomplished this or something like it?" The answer is almost always yes, so your investigation begins by finding out what others have learned.
- Books and published works offer the most in terms of documented research and role models for success. 
- The research and experience of others is the best place to start when looking for your answer.
- A new answer usually requires new behavior.
  - Think big and specific.
  - Think possibilities.
  - Benchmark and trend for the best answer.
