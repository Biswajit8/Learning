It encompasses various cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, reasoning, and emotional understanding. | a technology created by humans to simulate certain aspects of human intelligence. AI is designed to perform tasks that typically require human-like abilities, like understanding language, recognizing patterns, or making decisions. |
| Learning Process | involves a gradual learning process where individuals acquire skills over time through experience and observation. Humans learn from their interactions and the environment, adapting their understanding as they grow. | uses algorithms and data to learn from examples. This process, known as machine learning, enables AI systems to improve their performance based on the data they process, but it lacks the inherent intuition and ethical judgment present in natural intelligence. |
| Capability | can engage in subjective reasoning, moral judgments, and emotional responses, which are essential aspects of human interactions. | primarily functions on predefined algorithms and data. While it can handle complex calculations and tasks efficiently, it sometimes lacks the nuanced understanding required for certain situations, especially where ethical considerations are involved. |
