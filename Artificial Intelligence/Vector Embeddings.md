Vector embedding is a popular technique to represent information in a format that can be easily processed by algorithms, especially deep learning models. This ‘information’ can be text, pictures, video and audio.

## Text Embeddings

We can create Text Embedding that will give us more information about a word, such as its meaning, that computer can understand.

Why is it required? We want to capture the Semantics (the branch of linguistics & logic concerned with meaning) of a word.

For e.g., to find words which are similar in meaning to a given word.
- Given word: food. Similar words: tomato, lettuce

### Models to create Text Embeddings

1. OpenAI
2. Word2vec
3. GloVe

Text is just one of the things that we can vectorize. We can also vectorize sentences, documents, notes, graphs, images, even our faces.

### Some Uses

1. Recommendation systems
2. Anomaly detection
3. Transfer learning
4. Visualisations
5. Information retrieval
6. Audio + Speech processing
7. Facial recognition
