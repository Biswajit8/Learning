### Session 1: AI-First Prototyping & Science of Prompt

'Vibe Coding' = Coding using natural language prompts without needing to write the syntax yourself.

Google AI Studio: The prototyping sandbox for designing and tuning AI logic http://goo.gle/aistudio-india

NotebookLM: RAG-based research tool for analysing uploaded documents. No hallucinations from the web!
http://notebooklm.google.com

The 4 Pillars: PTCF Framework
- Persona: Who the AI should be. Sets the expertise level, vocabulary & approach
- Task: What the AI should do. Use clear action verbs (create, analyze, summarize, draft)
- Context: The background information. Include audience, constraints, goals & relevant details
- Format: How you want the output. Specify the exact structure you need

Advanced Prompting Techniques:
- Zero-Shot: Give a task with zero examples - AI uses training knowledge
- One-Shot: Provide one example to show the pattern 
- Few-Shot: Provide 2-10 examples for complex patterns
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Ask the AI to "think step by step"


Meta-Prompting: Using AI to write better prompts. For e.g.:

Improve this prompt to get better results. Follow prompt engineering best practices:

"Summarize this article"

Only return the improved prompt.

### Session 2: AI-Powered Research: De-risking Your Startup with Data

Gemini Deep Research:
- Your team of research interns
- Knows about the WORLD

NotebookLM:
- Your dedicated PHD specialist
- Knows about YOUR FILES

Deep Research is now inside NotebookLM

NotebookLM as your Drag-and-Drop RAG

RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation

The Hallucination Problem: AI generates plausible-sounding but completely wrong information

RAG Solves This in 6 steps:
- UPLOAD: You give NotebookLM your documents.
- QUESTION: You ask a question.
- RETRIEVAL: AI finds relevant sections from your files.
- AUGMENTATION: AI adds those sections as context to the prompt.
- GENERATION: AI generates an answer based only on that context.
- CITATION: The answer links directly to your sources.

Your Capstone Challenge:
- Step 1: Build Your Research Notebook
- Step 2: Discover Sources
- Step 3: Competitive Analysis
- Step 4: User Research Deep Dive
- Step 5: Pressure Test with a Skeptical VC
- Step 6: Build Your Action Plan

### Session 3: AI Creative Studio: Generating Copy, Designs, and Prototypes

The AIDA framework:
- A: Attention
- I: Interest
- D: Desire
- A: Action

Visual Prompt Formula:
1. STYLE: The artistic approach (Photorealistic, vector, 3D, etc.)
2. SUBJECT: What/who + specific details (Age, clothing, action, etc.)
3. COMPOSITION: How it’s framed (Angle, focal point, spacing, etc.)
4. LIGHTING: The mood setter (Time of day, natural/artificial, etc.)

GEMINI AS A REPL (READ–EVAL–PRINT–LOOP)
- READ: Enter command
- EVAL: System processes
- PRINT: See result
- LOOP: Iterate

Your 2-Week Validation Plan

WEEK 1: QUALITATIVE TESTING
Share landing page with 10 of your 150 beta users
Ask 3 questions:
- “What’s the first thing you notice?”
- “Does this make you want to use PayNow more, less, or the same?”
- “Would you share this with a friend? Why or why not?”

WEEK 2: ITERATE & VALIDATE
- Common feedback: “Headline is confusing” → Regenerate in Gemini
- Common feedback: “I don’t get PayNow Points” → Add explanation section
- Each iteration: 10 minutes (prompt → generate → save → test)

Aim for 3–5 iteration cycles.

Decision point
- 8+ users excited → Messaging works, invest in professional development
- 5–7 users interested → Directionally right, keep iterating
- <5 users engaged → Positioning problem, revisit Session 2 insights

Your Capstone Challenge:

STEP 1
Define your brand voice
- Use PTCF framework
- Generate 5 sample lines
- Save it

STEP 2
Create Visual Asset
- Generate 2 visuals using Nano Banana
- Flat vector app icons
- Landing page hero image
- Style → Subject → Composition → Lighting formula

STEP 3
Run the Cross-Modal Loop
- Pick an inspiration
- Get detailed breakdown
- Rewrite it in brand voice and style

STEP 4
Landing page
- Gemini to write code
- Test the page and 2 quick improvements

### Session 4: AI Prototyping Sandbox: Mastering Google AI Studio

Temperature = Creativity Control
- High Temp -> More imaginative, creative & unpredictable
- Low Temp -> More consistent & predictable

Top-p Controls Word Choices

Reduce p -> Smaller buffet Tighter answers

p = 1 -> full range

p = 0.5 -> only

most likely words

Temperature + Top-p control creativity
- Lower = Discipline
- Higher = Playfulness

Default Config for Production Agents: Low Temperature + Medium Top p

Balanced Creativity: Temperature 1.3 + Top p 0.8

Structured Output (JSON) Making AI Machine-Readable

Few-Shot Schema Anchoring: Show one perfect example -> AI replicates format perfectly

Grounding: Connecting AI to Reality

Two Types:
1. Search Grounding (Broad Knowledge)
2. URL Context (Focused Facting)

Search Grounding = Real-Time Intel
- RBI rules, fintech news, competitor updates
- UPI limits, gateway status, new AI feature
- Perfect for live, fast-changing information

The Reliability Trifecta
- Low Temperature + Low Top‑p → Predictable, consistent outputs every time.
- Structured output → machine‑ready data.
​- Grounding → factual correctness.
​
From Static to Agentic
- Real‑time Listening
- Action Execution (Function Calling)
- Multimodal Interaction

Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio -> Real‑Time Multimodal Streaming

Real‑Time Use Cases of Real‑Time Multimodal Streaming:
- Onboarding Guide
​- Support Copilot
​- Engineering Assistant

Automating PayNow
- Customer Support Bot (Refunds/Status)​
- Merchant Dashboard (Live Data)​
- Compliance (KYC Automation)​
- Fraud Detection (Freeze/Alert)

Guardrails for Agentic AI
- Authentication (Who can trigger?)​
- Confirmation Loops (Human approval)​
- Rate Limiting (Prevent spam)​
- Audit Logging (Track everything)

Multimodal AI → Your Digital Teammate​

Vision + Voice + Function Calling = Automation Engine

3 Founder Questions
- How do I cut costs without losing quality?​
- Is my AI bleeding budget?​
- How do I secure the "Secret Key"?

The Two Metrics
- Accuracy (User Feedback/Evals)​
- Efficiency (Dashboard/Cost)

The Founder's Mental Model
- Prompts are code – Optimize them​
- Streaming is real-time – Measure it​
- Functions execute – Secure them​
- Keys connect – Protect them

### Session 5: AI Developer: From Prompt to Product in Minutes

The Two-Fold Approach
- Gemini as Coding Partner (Structure)​

The Iteration Toolkit

1. Code Assistant (Chat)​
2. Annotations (Visual)​
3. Device Preview (Mobile)

Assignment: The Iteration Loop
1. Build the app
2. Test on all devices​
3. Add 3 Annotations
4. Process changes
5. Make a “bad” change and Restore
6. Share Before/After

Assignment:
- Step 1: Identify the Problem - One manual, repetitive task.
- Step 2: Write the V1 Prompt - Inputs, Outputs, Functionality

Pro-Tip: Use Gemini to write your PRD first (Product Requirement Document)

- Step 3: Build It URL - https://goo.gle/aistudio-india
- Step 4: Iterate - Improve it at least 3 times.

### Session 6: AI Orchestrator: Deploying, Scaling, and Winning

The Meta-Pilot Prompt
```
I have a React website (uses vite) on GitHub, and I want to put it online using Google Cloud Run.
I am a beginner, so explain everything in very simple language.

Part 1: Create a Dockerfile
Please create a Dockerfile that does the following:
Uses Node 20 Alpine to build the React app
Takes a GEMINI_API_KEY and writes it into a .env.local file before building
After building, uses Nginx Alpine to serve the final build
Exposes port 8080
Runs Nginx in the foreground. There should be a separate nginx.conf file

Part 2: Simple Deployment Steps
Give me very easy, beginner‑friendly steps for:
Turning on Cloud Run and Cloud Build in Google Cloud
Opening the Cloud Run page
Connecting my GitHub repo
Telling Google to use my Dockerfile
Adding my GEMINI_API_KEY in the build settings
Allowing public access
Finding my final public website link.
```

The Builder’s Journey:
- Checkpoint 1: “Foundation & Prompting”
- Checkpoint 2: “NotebookLM & Multimodal”
- Checkpoint 3: “Creative Assets”
- Checkpoint 4: “AI Studio Control”
- Checkpoint 5: “Building Web Apps”
- Checkpoint 6: “Deployment & Shipping”

Idea → Product.
