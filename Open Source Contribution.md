### How to contribute?
1. Code contribution (more valuable)
   - Bug fix
   - Feature
2. Non-code contribution (documentation, testing)

Master a tech stack & find open source organizations (repositories)

It's always preferred to contribute in an organization / platform which you use in your daily life (e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ)

Google: Java open source projects

Open GitHub repo -> Issues -> Filter by Label "good first issue" or "help wanted" -> Open an issue read the details

Fork repo -> Clone it into local using 'git clone' -> Open in IDE

CONTRIBUTING.md contains the steps how to set it up on local to contribute.
