### How to contribute?
1. Code contribution (more valuable)
   - Bug fix
   - Feature
2. Non-code contribution (documentation, testing)

Master a tech stack & find open source organizations (repositories)

It's always preferred to contribute in an organization / platform which you use in your daily life (e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ)

Google: Java open source projects

cal.com -> Open GitHub link -> Issues -> Filter by Label "good first issue" or "help wanted" -> Open an issue read the details

Code -> Fork -> Clone it into local using 'git clone' -> Open in IDE

CONTRIBUTING.md contains the steps how to set it up on local to contribute.

After executing those steps, create a new branch with name like `fix/issue-number-description`.

```bash
git checkout -b "fix/11378-change-email-hint-text"
git add .
git commit -m "fixed the text for change email hint"
git push
```

Create PR in GitHub.

How to link a PR to an issue?
- In the PR description, write "Fixes #issue-no". For e.g., "Fixes #11378".
