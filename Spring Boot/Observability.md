**Three Pillars of Observability**

1. Logging: Detailed information about individual things that are ongoing in your application (printing logs for an application)
2. Metrics: Aggregated information about application features, over a period of time such as application's CPU, network & memory.
3. Tracing: Sampled information across multiple services (how long each service call took. A single trace displays the operation as it moves from one node to another in a distributed system)
